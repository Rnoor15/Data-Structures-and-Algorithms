You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 2. If you need to change it, please consult with me first.

You can compile everything by typing

make all

You can compile one program individually by just typing make <Program Name>, for example

make query_tree

Also, use the corresponding files to run each of the tests, and use to type of tree
you want, BST or AVL. Input files include rebase210.txt and sequences.txt./

By typing

make clean

You delete all .o files and executables.

Overall, project went smoothly. No issues with any parts. Some possible deviations
may come from the counting of recursive calls. One can either count the public call
to the private function as a recursive call, or you may not. This will lead to
an +- difference of 1, which is OK. Other than that all tree information was simply
found using templated routines. Project is completely finished.
